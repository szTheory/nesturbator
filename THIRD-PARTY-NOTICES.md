# Third-party notices

nesturbator is MIT-licensed (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)). Two things in this
repository come from elsewhere: the vendored `libretro/libretro.h`, and the
CPU test data under `tests/vectors/`. Holy Mapperel's test ROMs under
`tests/roms/hm/` are listed below too.

## SingleStepTests 65x02

CPU test vectors (test data, not code), converted to N65V by `tools/vecconv`
or cut as byte-range prefixes of the upstream JSON.

The test decoder in `tests/holymapperel/` carries the ROM's 8x8 font as a
table (tiles $30-$39 and $01-$06); the font is Holy Mapperel's.
