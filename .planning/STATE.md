# Project State

## Project Reference

See [PROJECT.md](PROJECT.md), updated 2026-10-25 after Phase 19, and AGENTS.md.
Core value: Games behave as on the console, identically across platforms, from a small MIT C library.
Current focus: v5 NMI, VBlank and sprite-0 timing (RM-004 in [PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md](PRODUCT-ROADMAP.md)); Phase 20 NMI line and VBlank flag.

## Current Position

Phase: 20 (NMI line and VBlank flag) — BLOCKED AT EVIDENCE CHECKPOINT
Plan: 1/6 complete; 20-02 Task 1 blocked, 0/3 tasks complete
Status: Awaiting independent detector-order evidence or explicit acceptance revision
Last activity: 2026-10-26 — Independent six-case die-network oracle reproduced; exact paired-chip A/C boundary remains unresolved

Progress: [███░░░░░░░] 33%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

- [Phase 20 oracle research]: The owner selected independent hardware/source research. A published Visual2A03 die-network probe now establishes six finite-margin sampling/retention outcomes; it separates internal phi2 from widened M2 and preserves the input/request stage distinction. The exact simultaneous PPU/CPU edge remains unverified, and no acceptance rule was relaxed. See [20-NMI-ORACLE-RESEARCH.md](phases/20-nmi-line-and-vblank-flag/20-NMI-ORACLE-RESEARCH.md).
- v5 build order follows research/SUMMARY.md: JAM attribution first; each phase writes its owned reproducers before its fix so main stays green; sprite-0 in its own phase before the NMI model; NMI line and edge latch before the poll; shared interrupt entry and hijack last.
- KEEP-02 and KEEP-03 sit in Phase 20 (hash moves, state format 2); KEEP-01 sits in Phase 21 (shared interrupt entry touches CPU vectors and the MMC3 IRQ). Every phase keeps the protected PASS set.
- [Phase 19]: JAM attribution: frame_and_sample returns nesturbator_status; ACCURACYCOIN_ACTIVE_RUNNING/BUDGET/JAM three-state classifier; execution-stage JAM is fail/0x03/guest-jam with exit 0
- [Phase 19]: 19-02: collector resolves the attributed JAM row by full key and classifies it with ACCURACYCOIN_ACTIVE_JAM; earlier-stage JAM writes no report and exits 1
- [Phase 19]: 19-03: STOP_JAM shows a never-written blank buffer for black so the cached picture survives; cache tag = frame_number + state-CRC timeline generation (D-16 amendment)
- [Phase 19]: D-10 amendment applied: cases 2, 4, 8, 9 and all-Y=$FF are guards; 1, 3, 5, 6, 7 and $FD are reproducers run through expect_red until their fix lands
- [Phase 19]: 19-05: page-19 driver case uses case-local execution cap 300; campaign caps unchanged; state/* hash rows re-pinned for behaviour revision 7
- [Phase 19]: 19-06: AccuracyCoin baseline re-recorded from measured full campaign (108 pass/38 fail/0 timeout); matched research prediction
- [Phase 20 planning]: Six sequential plans cover reproducers, split status/line capture with coherent state format 2/revision 8, NMI polling, exact race-state continuation, host replay and final evidence. Independent plan check passed after isolating four new test oracles; all four requirements and 24 decisions are assigned.
- [Phase 20]: Keep live PPU, bus, and guest observations separate from source-assembly table comparator checks.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 20 execution]: Plan 20-02's three-candidate experiment rejects B on NMI Control but leaves A/C identical on all six live target rows. The owned probe distinguishes predictions without a hardware oracle. Task 1's explicit ambiguity stop applies; no production change or format/revision bump landed. See [20-02-CHECKPOINT.md](phases/20-nmi-line-and-vblank-flag/20-02-CHECKPOINT.md) for retained raw observations, source limits and resume choices. Plans 20-03 through 20-06 remain dependent and pending.
- Same-edge capture/side-effect order and default-alignment acceptance against all six complete tables remain bounded execution experiments (20-02/03); no alignment shift is assumed.
- The constructed NMI-disabled set/clear probe proves limited exact instruction-boundary save/load feasibility with audio history. Enabled-NMI and edge-before-poll continuation remain 20-04 acceptance work; an unrepresentable required cutpoint blocks KEEP-03 pending explicit clarification.
- The pause handoff records three Nightly vectors-full fetch failures on 2026-10-26 (curl 28 / bad pack header from the upstream 65x02 download). This was external to Phase 19 and not a required PR check. Quick task 261026-i8z preserved the cold-fetch policy; no fresh hosted recheck was run.

## Delivery

Phase 16 is on main and released as v0.1.11. Phases 17 and 18 merged as PR #55 (exact-head CI 40150921041 green; Nightly 40150888217 success); PR #54 was folded into it. Release PR #56 (0.1.12) was open at the v5 opening; record its publication in MILESTONES.md once observed. Phase 19 squash-merged as PR #57 on 2026-10-26 (`ab9c2e6`), after the CI repairs documented in `debug/resolved/pr57-ci-failures.md`. Branch `gsd/phase-20-nmi-line-and-vblank-flag` was created and pushed from that main. Phase 20 context, research, six plans and a passed plan check are recorded. Plan 20-01 completed the owned test and measurement work; production emulation changes remain in later plans.

## Deferred Items

Items acknowledged and deferred at milestone close, most recent first:

| Category | Item | Status | Deferred At | Milestone |
|----------|------|--------|-------------|-----------|
| debug_sessions | phase16-cleanup-fixture | verifying | 2026-10-24 | v4 |
| debug_sessions | phase16-interruption | investigating | 2026-10-24 | v4 |
| deferred_items | 16-host-evidence-and-roadmap/deferred-items.md: local macOS nofp reports Apple-toolchain stack_chk_fail/stack_chk_guard symbols | acknowledged | 2026-10-24 | v4 |

Seven seed acknowledgements from earlier closes remain suppressed by their own `audit_acknowledged` markers.

## Preserved Debt

- Nightly run 39993108154: vectors-full failed (not a Release gate).
- [Phase 19] Code review advisories open in 19-REVIEW-DISPOSITION.md: sprite-0 hit set only inside compose_pixel (held by NULL-video rejection), single jam_state_crc may blank an earlier jammed state under run-ahead, per-frame save_state cost in the adapter.
- [Phase 19] Navigation- and start-stage JAM branches share the boot-stage code but only boot is constructed in a test.
- [Phase 19] 19-06 baseline-metadata records a local dirty-tree run (source_dirty=1); a clean hosted run should confirm it.
- Real-campaign minimization is proven only by controls.
- Historical metadata warnings (16-05 command strings as paths; three Phase 17 references) do not change any verdict.
- Preexisting `.planning/config.json` edits remain unstaged.

## Next Action

Use the independently reproduced six-case circuit oracle in [20-NMI-ORACLE-RESEARCH.md](phases/20-nmi-line-and-vblank-flag/20-NMI-ORACLE-RESEARCH.md) to constrain CPU capture. To resolve [20-02-CHECKPOINT.md](phases/20-nmi-line-and-vblank-flag/20-02-CHECKPOINT.md), still obtain a source-backed PPU-output-to-CPU-input schedule or paired-chip measurement, or explicitly revise acceptance before resuming 20-02. The owner authorized research, not a provisional A choice. Do not repeat the exhausted three-candidate sweep or dispatch dependent plans. Plan 20-01's full workflow passed 677/677; the restored-tree focused suite passed 4/4. Three testing proposals remain proposed future scope. The CI speed-up quick task is implemented in `dbbf04f`; its separate title workflow remains deferred pending a coordinated required-check ruleset migration.
