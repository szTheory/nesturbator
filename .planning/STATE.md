# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-02)

**Core value:** Games behave as they do on the console, identically on every platform, from a small MIT-licensed C library that any host can embed.
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — A test frame in RetroArch

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (A test frame in RetroArch) — EXECUTING
Plan: 4 of 12
Status: Ready to execute
Last activity: 2026-10-02 — Phase 01 execution started

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table; the full list with sources is `.planning/preparation/DECISIONS.md`.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: four phases, one per requirement category; merging each phase's pull request publishes a release.
- Roadmap: each phase's detail section in ROADMAP.md lists its canonical refs under `.planning/preparation/`; open them before designing or building.
- [Phase 01]: Runner tests check exact stdout and exit status through tests/cmake/expect_output.cmake; EXPECT is a list of lines
- [Phase 01]: Runner numbers are decimal 1 to 4294967295; repeated --hash-frame N prints frame N once
- [Phase 01]: header.cxx compiles the public header as C++11, the oldest standard with static_assert
- [Phase 01]: Core tests are plain programs on tests/check.h registered with nesturbator_core_test()
- [Phase 01]: palgen samples phase p at 75+30p degrees with U on the sine and V on the cosine, so colorburst (hue 8) lands on -U
- [Phase 01]: Generated palette banner is ASCII (--) so all sources stay ASCII for MSVC /WX
